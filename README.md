PySOM - The Simple Object Machine Smalltalk implemented in Python
=================================================================

Introduction
------------

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Århus
(Denmark) where it was used for teaching and as the foundation for [Resilient
Smalltalk][RS].

In addition to PySOM, other implementations exist for Java (SOM, TruffleSOM),
C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains the Python-based implementation of SOM, including
SOM's standard library and a number of examples. Please see the [main project
page][SOM] for links to other VM implementations.

PySOM's tests can be executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello/Hello.som
